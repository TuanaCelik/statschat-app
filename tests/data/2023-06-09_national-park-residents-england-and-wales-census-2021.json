            "section_text": "Overall, 399,400 people lived in national parks in England and Wales in 2021 (0.67% of the usual resident population). The median age was higher in every national park than it was elsewhere in England and Wales, with the highest median age in the Broads (57 years). National park residents were more likely to identify with the \"White: British\" ethnic group and the \"Christian\" religion, and were more likely to speak English (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language, than residents elsewhere in England and Wales. National park residents tended to have a higher level of education than residents elsewhere in England and Wales, and were also more likely to be retired. After standardising by age, national park residents tended to be in better health and were less likely to be disabled than residents elsewhere in England and Wales. Households in national parks were more likely to be in detached properties and to own their properties outright compared with other households in England and Wales.",

This was followed by the Lake District (39,000 residents, 17,800 households) and the Peak District (35,900 residents, 16,200 households). The least populated national parks were Northumberland (1,800 residents, 800 households) and the Broads (6,300 residents, 3,100 households).In Wales, the most populated national park was Bannau Brycheiniog (33,500 residents, 15,000 households) and the least populated was the Pembrokeshire Coast (20,900 residents, 9,800 households).The Pembrokeshire Coast also had the largest population decline since 2011 of all national parks in England and Wales, at 7.6% (from 22,600 usual residents in 2011). The next highest decline was in Northumberland, at 7.3% (from 2,000 in 2011).

As such, comparisons between 2011 and 2021 are not provided for these national parks. Population density was considerably lower in each national park than it was in England and Wales as a whole (395 people per square kilometre).

Similarly, the percentage identifying with any \"White\" ethnic group was higher in all national parks (ranging from 95.8% in the South Downs to 98.6% in both Northumberland and the Yorkshire Dales) than it was in other parts of England (81.0%) and Wales (93.7%).Correspondingly, there were fewer people in ethnic minority groups in national parks than elsewhere. For example, the percentage who identified with an \"Asian\" ethnic group in national parks ranged from 0.4% (in Exmoor, Northumberland, North York Moors, and the Yorkshire Dales) to 1.9% (in Bannau Brycheiniog), which is considerably lower than elsewhere in England (9.7%) and Wales (2.9%).

The data for national parks show that the percentage of usual residents aged 3 years and over who could speak Welsh was considerably higher in Eryri (56.0%) than it was in non-national park areas of Wales (17.0%). The percentage was also higher in the Pembrokeshire Coast (19.0%), whereas fewer people spoke Welsh in Bannau Brycheiniog (12.7%).ReligionFinally, for religion, there tended to be more people who identified as \"Christian\" in national parks than elsewhere. The percentage of national park residents identifying as \"Christian\" ranged from 47.7% (in Dartmoor) to 60.3% (in the North York Moors), which is higher than other parts of England (46.3%) and Wales (43.4%).Correspondingly, there tended to be fewer non-Christian religious groups in national parks. For example, the percentage identifying as \"Muslim\" did not exceed 0.4% in any national park (0.4% identified as \"Muslim\" in the South Downs), which is considerably lower than in other parts of England (6.8%) and Wales (2.2%).However, this pattern did not hold for people who identified as \"Buddhist\". Several national parks, particularly Northumberland (0.9%), Bannau Brycheiniog (0.7%), and Dartmoor (0.7%), had higher proportions of residents identifying as \"Buddhist\" than other parts of England (0.5%) and Wales (0.3%).",

Infants aged under 1 year are classified as 0 years of age.DisabilityPeople who assessed their day-to-day activities as limited by long-term physical or mental health conditions or illnesses are considered disabled. This definition of a disabled person meets the harmonised standard for measuring disability and is in line with the Equality Act (2010).Ethnic groupThe ethnic group that the person completing the census feels they belong to. This could be based on their culture, family background, identity or physical appearance.Respondents could choose 1 out of 19 tick-box response categories, including write-in response options.General healthA person's assessment of the general state of their health from \"very good\" to \"very bad\". This assessment is not based on a person's health over any specified period of time.Highest qualificationThe highest level of qualification is derived from the question asking people to indicate all qualifications held, or their nearest equivalent.This may include foreign qualifications where they were matched to the closest UK equivalent.HouseholdA household is defined as:  one person living alone, or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room, or dining area This includes:  all sheltered accommodation units in an establishment (irrespective of whether there are other communal facilities), and all people living in caravans on any type of site that is their usual residence; this will include anyone who has no other usual residence elsewhere in the UK a household must contain at least one person whose place of usual residence is at the address; a group of short-term residents living together is not classified as a household, and neither is a group of people at an address where only visitors are staying Main languageA person's first or preferred language.National parkAn area in the countryside that is protected for their landscape. Each national park is managed by its own national park authority.ReligionThe religion people connect or identify with (their religious affiliation), whether or not they practise or have belief in it.This question was voluntary, and the variable includes people who answered the question, including \"No religion\", alongside those who chose not to answer this question.This variable classifies responses into the eight tick-box response options. Write-in responses are classified by their \"parent\" religious affiliation, including \"No religion\", where applicable.Usual residentA usual resident is anyone who on Census Day, 21 March 2021 was in the UK and had stayed or intended to stay in the UK for a period of 12 months or more, or had a permanent UK address and was outside the UK and intended to be outside the UK for less than 12 months.",

It is carried out every 10 years and gives us the most accurate estimate of all the people and households in England and Wales.We are responsible for carrying out the census in England and Wales but will also release outputs for the UK in partnership with the Welsh Government, the National Records of Scotland (NRS) and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). The census in Northern Ireland was also conducted on 21 March 2021, whereas Scotland's census was moved to 20 March 2022. All UK census offices are working closely together to understand how this difference in reference dates will affect UK-wide population and housing statistics, in terms of both timing and scope.Response rateThe person response rate is the number of usual residents for whom individual details were provided on a returned questionnaire, divided by the estimated usual resident population.The person response rate for Census 2021 was 97% of the usual resident population of England and Wales, and over 88% in all local authorities. Most returns (89%) were received online. The response rate exceeded our target of 94% overall and 80% in all local authorities.Read more about question-specific response rates at local authority level in Section 4 of our measures showing the quality of Census 2021 estimates.Age-standardised proportionsData on general health and disability have been standardised by age. Age-standardised proportions (ASPs) allow for fairer comparison between populations over time and across geographies, as they account for differences in the population size and age structure. The 2013 European Standard Population is used to standardise proportions.",
